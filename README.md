# Vehicle-Speed-Detection

1. Import the following libraries:
   - pandas
   - OpenCV
   - YOLO
   - Matplotlib
  
2. Download the `video.mp4` and `tracker.py` file
3. Make sure that these files are stored in the same folder as the `Vehicle Speed Detection.ipynb` file
4. On running the code the script starts going through the video frame by frame. All these frames are stored in a folder `detected_frames`
5. After all the frames are detected the video with the speed information of vehicles is downloaded. The result video will be saved by the name `output.mp4` in the folder
